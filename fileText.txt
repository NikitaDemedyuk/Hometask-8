Portugal is      the oldest	 nation state on the	 Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in 	Europe, its territory having been continuously settled, invaded 	and fought over since prehistoric times. It was inhabited by	 pre-Celtic and Celtic peoples, visited by Phoenicians-Carthaginians, Ancient 	Greeks and ruled by the Romans, who were followed by the invasions of the Suebi and Visigothic    Germanic   peoples. 		After the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula,    most of 	its territory was part of Al-Andalus. Portugal as a country      was established during the early Christian Reconquista. Founded in 868, 		the        County 	of Portugal gained prominence after the Battle of São Mamede (1128).       The Kingdom of Portugal was later proclaimed following the Battle of Ourique (1139), and      independence from León was recognized by the Treaty of        Zamora.
